# APC Responsive
Our AllPosters sites aren't responsive. This code will make them responsive. :tada:

## Setup
1. Fork the repo onto your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to download the necessary packages
3. Code all the things!
4. Once you've coded all the things, or a new feature or whatever, you can use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build it out to a gitignored `/dest` directory.
5. Here's some options:
  * `gulp-scripts` to compile all your JS
  * `gulp-styles` to compile all your stylus files
  * `gulp-nunjucks` to piece together all the templates
  * `gulp` default task will run all of the above

## Main packages
* [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) - css precompiler
* [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) by Mozilla
