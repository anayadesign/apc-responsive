# APC Responsive
Our AllPosters sites aren't responsive. This code will make them responsive. :tada:

## Setup
1. Fork the repo onto your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to download the necessary packages
3. Code all the things!
4. Once you've coded all the things, or a new feature or whatever, you can use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build it out to a gitignored `/dest` directory.
5. Here's some options:
  * `gulp scripts` to compile all your JS under `/source/scripts`
  * `gulp styles` to compile all your stylus files under `/source/stylus`
  * `gulp nunjucks` to piece together all the templates under `/source/pages` and `/source/templates`
  * `gulp` default task will run all of the above
  * `gulp serve` will run all of the above and launch a live-reloading `browser-sync` window. The task will watch for any changes to `.js`, `.styl`, or Nunjucks template files, and will reload the browser page after each change.

### Main packages
* [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
* [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) by Mozilla - HTML emplating

### Useful
Syntax highlighters are available on the Atom text-editor for [Stylus](https://atom.io/packages/stylus) and [Nunjucks](https://atom.io/packages/language-nunjucks).


## Folder structure
📁 /mockups/
* Contains `.jpg` design mockups for reference

📁 /source/
* Contains all the source code you'll be working on

📁 /source/pages/
* Contains Nunjucks **pages**. For example, `index.njk` file represents the homepage for APC, and contains header, body, and footer code. This file uses the `layout.njk` template to handle all the page metadata and HTML markup generated by Hippo CMS.

📁 /source/scripts/
* Contains javascript for the site. Each `.js` file under /scripts/ gets concatenated into one `main.js` file in alphabetical order.

📁 /source/stylus/
* Contains all the Stylus partials. Partials are then organized into footer, header, and home subdirectories. The `.styl` files in the /stylus root have global scope, except for `index.styl`, which is used as the main compilation file, gathering style declarations from all other partials.

📁 /source/templates/
* Contains Nunjucks partials, macros, and layouts in both `.njk` and `.html` filetypes.
